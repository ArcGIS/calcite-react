# Getting Started

## Intro

Calcite React is a component library built in React and used by Esri. It is an
implementation of Calcite, the geo-centric design language of Esri, aimed at
helping React developers to quickly build components that adhere to the Calcite
design language.

## Installation

```shell
npm i calcite-react
```

## Usage

### Theme Provider

Calcite React components rely on `<CalciteThemeProvider />` to access our theme
via [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). All Calcite React
components must be wrapped in this provider component in order to render
properly. In most cases, it's recommended to wrap your entire app at the highest
level.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import CalciteThemeProvider from 'calcite-react/CalciteThemeProvider';

import App from 'path/to/App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <CalciteThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </CalciteThemeProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Components

Below is a simple example of importing and using two Calcite React components.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import Button from 'calcite-react/Button';
import { CalciteH1 } from 'calcite-react/Elements';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <CalciteH1>My App uses Calcite headers and buttons!</CalciteH1>
        <Button>A Calcite Button!</Button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

## RTL
Right-to-left (RTL) is supported by Calcite React components with the `dir="rtl"`
attribute. The attribute must be applied to the `html` element to be inherited
properly by the library. This will mirror all components including changing the
`placement` used by `Tooltip`, `Popover`, and `Drawer`.
```jsx
<html dir="rtl" ...>
```
