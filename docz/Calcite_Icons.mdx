# Calcite Icons

## Icons as React Components

Calcite React uses the icons provided by [calcite-ui-icons](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-ui-icons)
to render elements in some components. Calcite React also comes packaged with the
[calcite-ui-icons-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/calcite-ui-icons-react) to
make it a little easier to use icons in your react project. You can [browse the icon set](https://esri.github.io/calcite-ui-icons/)
to see which icon works for you.

## Basic Usage

### Importing Icons
The name of the React component you will import is simply the icon name in PascalCase suffixed with `Icon`.

```jsx
/* layer-basemap becomes LayerBasemapIcon */
import LayerBasemapIcon from 'calcite-ui-icons-react/LayerBasemapIcon';

<LayerBasemapIcon />
```

### Size

The icons can take a `size` prop to adjust the rendered size of the icon. Calcite-ui-icons
has three sizes for every icon, we automatically select an icon for you based on the size
you specify.

<Playground>
  <LayerBasemapIcon size={16} />
  <LayerBasemapIcon size={24} />
  <LayerBasemapIcon size={32} />
  <LayerBasemapIcon size={64} />
</Playground>

### Outline vs. Filled

The icons also allow for you to specify whether it should use the outline style or the
`filled` style. Outline is the default for all calcite-icons

<Playground>
  <MagnifyingGlassIcon />
  <MagnifyingGlassIcon filled />
</Playground>

### Color

All components accept a color prop, which will be applied to the fill attribute on the 
`svg` element. This means any valid CSS color value can be used 
(e.g. "red", "#e34f2c", "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)"). If a color prop is not found, 
we will set it to "currentColor".

<Playground>
  <GlobeIcon color="red" />
  <GlobeIcon filled color="#1d5d8c" />
  <GlobeIcon filled color="rgba(155, 30, 95, 0.5)" />
</Playground>

### Gotchas

Since JavaScript variables cannot start with a number - we convert any icon name that begins with a number so that the word (or words, in PascalCase) are used instead.

Currently, there are only two such cases:

| Calcite UI Icons name | React Component Name |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `2d-explore`          | `TwoDExplore`        |
| `3d-glasses`          | `ThreeDGlasses`      |
