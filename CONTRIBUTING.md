# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in this project! Here are a few guidelines.

## Getting Started

To get started, go ahead and fork this repo. Once you've done that, there are a few things you should know before getting started.

### Before you Start

`npm install`

### NPM tasks

#### To run `docz`

`npm run docz:dev`

> Use docz as the primary development/test environment.

#### To build for production

`npm run build`

## Testing

After saving your changes and building for production, run `npm pack` in the dist folder to create a .tgz file that mimics a npm-published calcite-react package. Then run `npm install [filename].tgz` from your parent app to install the package locally and test drive the changes.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Once you're ready to submit your changes, submit a pull request **into the `develop` branch**. Often it's a good idea to open an issue to discuss your proposed changes before making a PR, but you're welcome to submit a PR without an issue - just be sure to include a good description of your changes.
