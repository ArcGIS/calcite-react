Menus are good for showing multiple options under a single call to action. For example, if you had a download button, and you needed the user to choose a format for the download, you could put several choices in a Menu.

Menus differ from select elements in that they don't have a default state or a 'current' state. Instead, they offer a jumping off point for a series of related actions.
