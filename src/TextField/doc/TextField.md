Labels for TextFields should describe what the field is. Labels should not be followed by a colon. Placeholder text should describe the specifics about formatting or examples for the input text. Placeholder text is optional, and should never be used to replace a label.

Required TextFields should have the required attribute. Optional TextFields should be clearly marked with "(optional)".

Try not to include too many optional fields, as it will make the form harder to comprehend and complete for the user.
