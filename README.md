## Quick Start

### To run `storybook`
> Use `storybook` as the primary development/test environment.

`npm run storybook`

### To run tests with Jest
> Jest testing is implemented with the help of [StoryShots](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots).

`npm test`

### To run tests (and [update the snapshot](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html#updating-snapshots))
>This should be used when you've made changes that will result in _expected_ UI changes.

`npm test -- -u`

### To build for production
>This process is still very rudimentary and will be further developed!

`npm run build`
