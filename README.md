# calcite-react
Calcite React is a component library built in React and used by Esri. It is an implementation of Calcite, the geo-centric design language of Esri, aimed at helping React developers to quickly build components that adhere to the Calcite design language.

## A work in progress
Be warned that this project is still under heavy development. At this point, you should expect that anything and everything will before we have a stable release.
